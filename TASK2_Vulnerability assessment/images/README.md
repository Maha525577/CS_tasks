# VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENT REPORT

**Internship Platform:** Internpe  
**Task Name:** Vulnerability Assessment  
**Student Name:** SOWBHAGYA TADI  
**Tools Used:** VirtualBox, Metasploitable, Nmap, OpenVAS  
**Date:** 28/01/2026

## INTRODUCTION

The objective of this task is to perform a Vulnerability Assessment on the
Metasploitable virtual machine. This helps in identifying potential weaknesses
that can be exploited by attackers.

---

## TOOLS USED

1. **VirtualBox** – Virtual environment  
2. **Metasploitable** – Vulnerable Linux OS  
3. **Nmap** – Network scanning  
4. **OpenVAS** – Vulnerability scanning and assessment  

---

## ENVIRONMENT SETUP

Metasploitable VM was configured in VirtualBox. Network adapter set to NAT /
Bridged Adapter to allow scanning and vulnerability testing.

---

## VULNERABILITY SCANNING

1. Nmap was used to scan open ports and running services  
2. OpenVAS was used to scan for known vulnerabilities  

---

## IDENTIFIED VULNERABILITIES

1. Open FTP and Telnet services (unencrypted)  
2. Weak passwords on user accounts  
3. Open database ports without authentication  
4. SMB and NetBIOS vulnerabilities  

---

## OBSERVATIONS

1. Multiple high-risk vulnerabilities detected  
2. Services running without encryption  
3. Network misconfigurations can allow unauthorized access

## CONCLUSION

This task provided hands-on experience in detecting vulnerabilities on a
vulnerable system. It reinforces the importance of patching, strong passwords,
and network security.
